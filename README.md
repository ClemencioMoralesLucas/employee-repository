## Introduction

This microservice, written in ```Java 11```, exposes a ```REST API``` that persist data inside a ```H2 Database``` according to 
the ```Hierarchy GmbH``` specs.

## Features

This repository fulfills the following business-written features:

##### 1
I would like a pure REST API to post the JSON from Chris. I would like to have a properly formatted JSON which reflects the employee hierarchy.
##### 2
I would like the API to be secure so that only I can use it.
##### 3 
Avoid nonsense hierarchies that contain loops or multiple roots.
##### 4 
I would really like it if the hierarchy could be stored in a relational database.
##### 5 
I want to send the name of an employee to an endpoint, and receive the name of the supervisor and the name of the supervisorâ€™s supervisor in return.

## Swagger

In order to use the REST API (and apart from [PostMan](https://www.postman.com/)), the 
[Swagger](https://www.swagger.io/) UI with [Open API](https://www.openapis.org/)
has been added.

Thanks to Swagger (an Interface Description Language for describing RESTful APIs expressed using JSON) the REST API
can be accessed from: ```http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config```

## Running the Application

#### How to run the Spring Boot Application 

* A ```Makefile```  has been added in order to smoothly run the Employee Hierarchy Application by running:
```make run```. This will automatically launch the ```Spring Boot``` application, exposing its
endpoints and making them available. The ```Makefile``` also allows ```make testAll``` in order to run
all the tests except for the Acceptance suite.

* In order to run the ```Acceptance Tests```, the command ```make run``` is to be executed first to 
start the ```Spring Boot``` application. Once it is correctly started, the test 
```src/test/java/com/personio/acceptance/AcceptanceTests.java``` can be executed from an ```IDE```.

* If you prefer to launch the application from your favorite ```IDE``` just launch
  ```src/main/java/com/personio/employeehierarchy/EmployeeHierarchyApplication.java```.  The
  next section in this ```README.md``` file points to the ```POSTMan``` collection you can import to easily
  play with the application.

## Assumptions

* Every employee name is unique and cannot be duplicated.
* An empty (```{}```) organization will not be accepted to boost throughput and to avoid an unnecessary database call.
* The system is to be protected for a single user with credentials ```user``` and ```password```. 
Simply putting these two credentials on ```Authorization``` tab (```Basic Auth``` as ```Type``` in 
[PostMan](https://www.postman.com/)) will allow the user to operate the ```REST API```.
 It is important to note that, for simplicity, the password is plain-text on the file, but on a real 
 application this should be encoded 
 (i.e: using ```PasswordEncoderFactories.createDelegatingPasswordEncoder()```)

## Notes

* The branch ```custom-whitelabel``` contains a commit with a mechanism to show HTML pages when 
404, 500 and generic errors appear using the REST API. In order to be more specific regarding
errors (cycles/multiple roots), this work has not been merged into master, but it is available
in the aforementioned branch for further reference. 

* In order to run all tests, ```mvn clean verify``` can be executed from the Terminal.
Apart from executing all tests, it generate an extensive report thanks to 
[JaCoCo](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/), that has been
added to the project. After running ```mvn clean verify```, these reports can be analyzed at 
```http://localhost:63342/employee-hierarchy/target/site/jacoco/index.html```

* The H2 Admin Console has been added to simplify any management-related operations
 with the database, and can be accessed through ```http://localhost:8080/h2-console/login.do```
 after launching the application.
 
 * The H2 Database has been indexed via the field ```EMPLOYEE.NAME``` to boost performance.
 It was possible to achieve this index creation in one fell swoop during the init
 script, ```schema.sql```, thanks to adding the flag ```mode=mysql``` to the datasource url in 
 ```application.yml```.
 
## Scripts
 
 The directory ```dotfiles``` is intended for any useful script. It contains
 the BASH script ```GET_TO_DA_CHOPPA``` as a funny way of pushing a new ```commit``` 
 to the ```master```  branch. In a nutshell, the script will only ```commit```
 and subsequently ```push``` if ```mvn clean verify``` finishes with 
 ```BUILD SUCCESS```. 
 
 To run it, just execute the following command from the terminal line:
 
  ```sh dotfiles/GET_TO_DA_CHOPPA.sh <YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE>"```
 
 If all the test are running fine, you should hear a cool ```MP3``` voice message, and see the ```ASCII``` art:
 
 ```
                      ______
                    <((((((\\\
                    /      . }\
                    ;--..--._|}
 (\                 '--/\--'  )
  \\                | '-'  :'|
   \\               . -==- .-|
    \\               \.__.'   \--._
    [\\          __.--|       //  _/'--.
    \ \\       .'-._ ('-----'/ __/      \
     \ \\     /   __>|      | '--.       |
      \ \\   |   \   |     /    /       /
       \ '\ /     \  |     |  _/       /
        \  \       \ |     | /        /
         \  \      \        /`
```
 Otherwise...I will let you discover it! ðŸ‘»
 
 As a side note, the script is inspired on the great action film **Predator**. (A 1987 American 
 science fiction action horror film directed by John McTiernan featuring
 Arnold Schwarzenegger.)

## TODO List

The following aspects would be a nice-to-have for the future, but were not implemented yet:
* Dockerize the application.
* Add Zipkin and Sleuth for monitoring.
* Enrich Makefile to run acceptance tests.
