## Introduction

This microservice, written in ```Java 11```, exposes a ```REST API``` that persist data inside a ```H2 Database``` according to 
the ```Hierarchy GmbH``` specs.

## Features

This repository fulfills the following business-written features:

##### 1
I would like a pure REST API to post the JSON from Chris. I would like to have a properly formatted JSON which reflects the employee hierarchy.
##### 2
I would like the API to be secure so that only I can use it.
##### 3 
Avoid nonsense hierarchies that contain loops or multiple roots.
##### 4 
I would really like it if the hierarchy could be stored in a relational database.
##### 5 
I want to send the name of an employee to an endpoint, and receive the name of the supervisor and the name of the supervisorâ€™s supervisor in return.

## Examples

The whole PostMan collection listed below can be imported from the path ```postman-collection/Employee Hierarchy.postman_collection.json```

## Assumptions

* Every employee name is unique and cannot be duplicated.
* An empty (```{}```) organization will not be accepted to boost throughput and to avoid an unnecessary database call.
* The system is to be protected for a single user with credentials ```user``` and ```password```. 
Simply putting these two credentials on ```Authorization``` tab (```Basic Auth``` as ```Type``` in 
[PostMan](https://www.postman.com/)) will allow the user to operate the ```REST API```.
 It is important to note that, for simplicity, the password is plain-text on the file, but on a real 
 application this should be encoded 
 (i.e: using ```PasswordEncoderFactories.createDelegatingPasswordEncoder()```)

## Notes

* The branch ```custom-whitelabel``` contains a commit with a mechanism to show HTML pages when 
404, 500 and generic errors appear using the REST API. In order to be more specific regarding
errors (cycles/multiple roots), this work has not been merged into master, but it is available
in the aforementioned branch for further reference. 

* In order to run all tests, ```mvn clean verify``` can be executed from the Terminal.
Apart from executing all tests, it generate an extensive report thanks to 
[JaCoCo](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/), that has been
added to the project. After running ```mvn clean verify```, these reports can be analyzed at 
```http://localhost:63342/employee-hierarchy/target/site/jacoco/index.html```

* The H2 Admin Console has been added to simplify any management-related operations
 with the database, and can be accessed through ```http://localhost:8080/h2-console/login.do```
 after launching the application.
 
 * The H2 Database has been indexed via the field ```EMPLOYEE.NAME``` to boost performance.
 It was possible to achieve this index creation in one fell swoop during the init
 script, ```schema.sql```, thanks to adding the flag ```mode=mysql``` to the datasource url in 
 ```application.yml```.

## TODO List

The following aspects are a must-have:
* (+) FINAL CHECK: Ensure all in the PDF works properly

The following aspects would be a nice-to-have:
* (-) Makefile to run springboot? (document it in readme)
* (-) swagger doc
* (-) Script for pushing - get to tha choppa
* (-) fix zipkin warn
* (-) Docker?
* (+) FINAL DOUBLE-CHECK BEFORE DELIVERY: Ensure all in the PDF works properly
